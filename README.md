# AutoAI-With-ChatGPT4

Auto-GPT stands as an experimental open-source application that demonstrates the prowess of the GPT-4 language model. Fueled by GPT-4, this application links LLM "thoughts" to independently accomplish your specified objectives. As a pioneering instance of GPT-4 operating autonomously, Auto-GPT expands the horizons of AI capabilities.

Environment (pick one) VSCode + devcontainer: It has been configured in the .devcontainer folder and can be used directly Docker Python 3.10 or later (instructions: for Windows) OpenAI API key

Optional Memory backend (pick one) Pinecone Milvus Redis ElevenLabs Key (If you want the AI to speak)

üíæ Installation

To install Auto-GPT, follow these steps:

1. _Make sure you have all the **requirements** listed above, if not, install/get them To execute the following commands, open a CMD, Bash, or Powershell window by navigating to a folder on your computer and typing_ ```CMD``` _in the folder path at the top, then press enter._

2. Clone the repository: For this step, you need Git installed

```git clone https://github.com/StephanFWard/AutoAI-With-ChatGPT4.git```

3. Navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded

```cd Auto-GPT``` 

4. Install the required dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt Configure Auto-GPT```

5.
  1. Locate the file named ```.env.template``` in the main ```/Auto-GPT``` folder.
  2. Create a copy of this file, called ```.env``` by removing the template extension. The easiest way is to do this in a command prompt/terminal window ```cp .env.template .env```.
  3. Open the ```.env``` file in a text editor. _Note: Files starting with a dot might be hidden by your Operating System._
  4. Find the line that says ```OPENAI_API_KEY=```.
  5. After the ```"="```, enter your unique OpenAI API Key (without any quotes or spaces).
  6. Enter any other API keys or Tokens for services you would like to utilize.
  7. Save and close the ```.env``` file.

By completing these steps, you have properly configured the API Keys for your project.

See OpenAI API Keys Configuration to obtain your OpenAI API key. 
Obtain your ElevenLabs API key from: https://elevenlabs.io. 
You can view your xi-api-key using the "Profile" tab on the website. 
If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set ```USE_AZURE``` to ```True``` and then follow these steps: Rename ```azure.yaml.template``` to ```azure.yaml``` and provide the relevant ```azure_api_base```, ```azure_api_version``` and all the deployment IDs for the relevant models in the 

azure_model_map

section: ```fast_llm_model_deployment_id``` - your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment ID 
```smart_llm_model_deployment_id``` - your gpt-4 deployment ID 
```embedding_model_deployment_id``` - your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment ID 

Please specify all of these values as double-quoted strings

```
# Replace string in angled brackets (<>) to your own ID
azure_model_map:
  fast_llm_model_deployment_id: "<my-fast-llm-deployment-id>"

**OpenAI API Keys Configuration**

Obtain your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

To use OpenAI API key for Auto-GPT, you NEED to have billing set up (AKA paid account).

You can set up paid account at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview.

For OpenAI API key to work, set up paid account at OpenAI API > Billing

üîç **Google API Keys Configuration**

This section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running a google search. To use the ```google_official_search``` command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables.

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in.
3. Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking "New Project". Give it a name and click "Create".
4. Go to the APIs & Services Dashboard (https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard?pli=1&supportedpurview=project) and click "Enable APIs and Services". Search for "Custom Search API" and click on it, then click "Enable".
5. Go to the Credentials page and click "Create Credentials". Choose "API Key".
6. Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named ```GOOGLE_API_KEY``` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.
7. Enable the Custom Search API on your project. (Might need to wait few minutes to propagate)
8. Go to the _Custom Search Engine_ page and click "Add".
9. Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.
10. Once you've created your search engine, click on "Control Panel" and then "Basics". Copy the "Search engine ID" and set it as an environment variable named ```CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID``` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.

_Remember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches._

**Setting up environment variables**

**For Windows Users:**

```
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
```
```
setx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
```

**For macOS and Linux users:**

```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
```
```
export CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
```

**Setting Your Cache Type**

By default, Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone.

To switch to either, change the ```MEMORY_BACKEND``` env variable to the value that you want:

```local``` (default) uses a local JSON cache file
```pinecone``` uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings
```redis``` will use the redis cache that you configured
```milvus``` will use the milvus cache that you configured
```weaviate``` will use the weaviate cache that you configured

**Memory Backend Setup**

**Redis Setup**

CAUTION This is not intended to be publicly accessible and lacks security measures. Therefore, avoid exposing Redis to the internet without a password or at all


1. Install docker (or Docker Desktop on Windows)

2. Launch Redis container

```
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

See https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration.

Set the following settings in ```.env```

Replace PASSWORD in angled brackets (<>)

```
MEMORY_BACKEND=redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD= <PASSWORD>
```

You can optionally set ```WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False``` to persist memory stored in Redis.

You can specify the memory index for redis using the following:

```
MEMORY_INDEX=<WHATEVER>
```

**üå≤ Pinecone API Key Setup**
Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.

1. Go to pinecone and make an account if you don't already have one.
2. Choose the ```Starter``` plan to avoid being charged.
3. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.

In the ```.env``` file set:

```PINECONE_API_KEY```
```PINECONE_ENV``` (example: "us-east4-gcp")
```MEMORY_BACKEND=pinecone```

Alternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced):

For Windows Users:

```setx PINECONE_API_KEY "<YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY>"```
```setx PINECONE_ENV "<YOUR_PINECONE_REGION>" # e.g: "us-east4-gcp"```
```setx MEMORY_BACKEND "pinecone"```

For macOS and Linux users:

```export PINECONE_API_KEY="<YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY>"```
```export PINECONE_ENV="<YOUR_PINECONE_REGION>" # e.g: "us-east4-gcp"```
```export MEMORY_BACKEND="pinecone"```

**Milvus Setup**
Milvus(https://milvus.io/) is a open-source, high scalable vector database to storage huge amount of vector-based memory and provide fast relevant search.

setup milvus database, keep your pymilvus version and milvus version same to avoid compatible issues.
setup by open source Install Milvus (https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-operator.md) or setup by Zilliz Cloud
set ```MILVUS_ADDR``` in ```.env``` to your milvus address ```host:ip```.
set ```MEMORY_BACKEND``` in ```.env``` to ```milvus``` to enable milvus as backend.

**Optional:**

set ```MILVUS_COLLECTION``` in ```.env``` to change milvus collection name as you want, ```autogpt``` is the default name.

**Weaviate Setup**

Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows to store data objects and vector embeddings from ML-models and scales seamlessly to billion of data objects. An instance of Weaviate can be created locally (using Docker), on Kubernetes or using Weaviate Cloud Services (https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart). Although still experimental, Embedded Weaviate (https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded) is supported which allows the Auto-GPT process itself to start a Weaviate instance. To enable it, ```set USE_WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED``` to ```True``` and make sure you ```pip install "weaviate-client>=3.15.4"```.

Setting up environment variables In your ```.env``` file set the following:

```MEMORY_BACKEND=weaviate
WEAVIATE_HOST="127.0.0.1" # the IP or domain of the running Weaviate instance WEAVIATE_PORT="8080"
WEAVIATE_PROTOCOL="http" WEAVIATE_USERNAME="your username"
WEAVIATE_PASSWORD="your password"
WEAVIATE_API_KEY="your weaviate API key if you have one"
WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED_PATH="/home/me/.local/share/weaviate" # this is optional and indicates where the data should be persisted when running an embedded instance
USE_WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED=False # set to True to run Embedded Weaviate MEMORY_INDEX="Autogpt" # name of the index to create for the application```

**View Memory Usage**

View memory usage by using the ```--debug``` flag :)

üß† **Memory pre-seeding**
Memory pre-seeding allows you to ingest files into memory and pre-seed it before running Auto-GPT.

```#python data_ingestion.py -h
usage: data_ingestion.py [-h] (--file FILE | --dir DIR) [--init] [--overlap OVERLAP] [--max_length MAX_LENGTH]

Ingest a file or a directory with multiple files into memory. Make sure to set your .env before running this script.

options: -h, --help show this help message and exit --file FILE The file to ingest. --dir DIR The directory containing the files to ingest. --init Init the memory and wipe its content (default: False) --overlap OVERLAP The overlap size between chunks when ingesting files (default: 200) --max_length MAX_LENGTH The max_length of each chunk when ingesting files (default: 4000)

# python data_ingestion.py --dir DataFolder --init --overlap 100 --max_length 2000
```

In the example above, the script initializes the memory, ingests all files within the ```Auto-Gpt/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/DataFolder``` directory into memory with an overlap between chunks of 100 and a maximum length of each chunk of 2000.

Note that you can also use the ```--file``` argument to ingest a single file into memory and that data_ingestion.py will only ingest files within the ```/auto_gpt_workspace directory```.

The DIR path is relative to the ```auto_gpt_workspace directory```, so ```python data_ingestion.py --dir . --init``` will ingest everything in ```auto_gpt_workspace``` directory.

You can adjust the ```max_length``` and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the docuents are presented to the AI when it "recall" that memory:

Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests. 
Reducing the ```max_length``` value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks.
Increasing the ```max_length value``` will provide the AI with more contextual information from each chunk, reducing the number of chunks created and saving on OpenAI API requests. However, this may also use more prompt tokens and decrease the overall context available to the AI. Memory pre-seeding is a technique for improving AI accuracy by ingesting relevant data into its memory. Chunks of data are split and added to memory, allowing the AI to access them quickly and generate more accurate responses. It's useful for large datasets or when specific information needs to be accessed quickly. Examples include ingesting API or GitHub documentation before running Auto-GPT.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you use Redis as your memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with the WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False in your .env file.

‚ö†Ô∏èFor other memory backend, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backend, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run.

Memories will be available to the AI immediately as they are ingested, even if ingested while Auto-GPT is running.

**üíÄ Continuous Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è** Run the AI **without** user authorization, 100% automated. Continuous mode is NOT recommended. It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorize. Use at your own risk.

Run the ```autogpt``` python module in your terminal:

```python -m autogpt --speak --continuous``` 

To exit the program, press Ctrl + C

**GPT3.5 ONLY Mode** If you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT!

```python -m autogpt --speak --gpt3only``` 

It is recommended to use a virtual machine for tasks that require high security measures to prevent any potential harm to the main computer's system and data.

üñº Image Generation By default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a Hugging Face API Token is required.

Once you have a token, set these variables in your .env:

```IMAGE_PROVIDER=sd``` 
```HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"``` 

**Selenium** 

```sudo Xvfb :10 -ac -screen 0 1024x768x24 & DISPLAY=:10 <YOUR_CLIENT>``` 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations** 

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment.
2.  May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3.  Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
